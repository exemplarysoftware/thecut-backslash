The Cut Django App: Backslash and Core



===========
thecut.core
===========

To install this application (whilst in the project's activated
virtualenv)::
    pip install git+ssh://git@git.thecut.net.au/thecut-core@0.03#egg=thecut


Optionally, add the ``current_site`` context processor to the
project's ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` setting::

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        ...
        'thecut.core.context_processors.current_site',
    )

There is no need to add ``thecut.core`` to your project's
``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting, as it provides only abstract models.
